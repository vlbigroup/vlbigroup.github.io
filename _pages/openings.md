# Open positions

### Postdoctoral Position in VLBI Studies of Black Holes and Blazars at IAA-CSIC with a Focus on the Event Horizon Telescope 
   
<p>We are looking for a postdoc to join our team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC), funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101093934, and the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación through grant PID2022-180888NB-C21. The position will start as soon as the right candidate is found and will last for a period of 2+1 years. The successful applicant will develop VLBI dynamic imaging/modeling pipelines, primarily aimed at supporting the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), while ensuring their applicability to other VLBI arrays. The selected applicant will also be involved in the deployment of the new ngEHT antenna in the Canary Islands, contributing expertise to both the scientific research and technical execution of this project.</p>

<p>This position offers the opportunity to engage in the development and application of multiple VLBI imaging pipelines, utilizing a range of techniques from CLEAN to Regularized Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian methods, and Neural Network approaches, with a particular emphasis on the EHT. Comparing relativistic numerical simulations with actual EHT observations of black holes through these innovative VLBI imaging pipelines provides a unique avenue to enhance our understanding of black hole physics. Additionally, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to delve into blazar studies from a multi-wavelength perspective, spanning radio to very high-energy emissions, and participate in other collaborations such as the BU Blazar Monitoring Program and the MOJAVE project. There is also a strong emphasis on space VLBI, notably through the analysis of RadioAstron data, with an aim to extend our contributions to future millimeterwave space VLBI projects, especially the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</p>

<p>Candidates should possess a Ph.D. in Physics or Astrophysics and have a strong foundation in VLBI observations and computational skills, particularly in areas related to black holes, relativistic jets, AGNs, blazars, multi-wavelength observations, and numerical simulations. Excellent communication skills and the ability to work effectively in an international collaborative environment are essential.</p>

<p>Interested applicants are encouraged to submit a curriculum vitae, a concise cover letter (1-2 pages) detailing their research interests and how they align with the project’s objectives, and three letters of recommendation, which should be sent directly to Dr. José L. Gómez at jlgomez@iaa.es. We aim to fill this position as soon as a suitable candidate is found, so all application materials **should be submitted preferably by the end of April** for timely consideration.</p>

<p>For any further inquiries regarding the position or the application process, potential candidates are invited to contact Dr. Gómez.</p>
